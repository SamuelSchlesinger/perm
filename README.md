# Perm

A Rust library for manipulating permutations efficiently and ergonomically.

Currently, it is in very early stages, with only basic representations under
development. Once these basic ergonomics are worked out, we will implement
methods for generating strong bases and do group theory algorithms. A nice
end state to this would be having the ability to generate efficient circuits
for functions which respect transformations from various subgroups of the
symmetric group.
